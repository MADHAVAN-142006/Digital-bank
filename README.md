🏦 BlueVault Digital Banking

A secure full-stack Digital Banking application built using Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

BlueVault simulates real-world banking operations including authentication, account management, deposits, withdrawals, and inter-user fund transfers using a secure stateless architecture.

🚀 Project Overview

BlueVault Digital Banking is a REST-based backend system integrated with a dynamic frontend interface.

The project focuses on:

Secure JWT-based authentication

Clean layered backend architecture

Real-world banking workflows

Secure inter-user fund transfer

Persistent relational database integration

The application follows modern backend engineering practices with emphasis on security, scalability, and maintainability.

🔐 Security Implementation
🔒 Password Security

Passwords encrypted using BCrypt hashing

No plain-text password storage

🔑 JWT Authentication

Token generated upon successful login

Stateless authentication (no server-side sessions)

All protected endpoints require:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

🛡 Spring Security Configuration

Custom authentication filter

Token validation per request

Unauthorized request handling

🏗 System Architecture

BlueVault follows a structured layered architecture:

Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
↓
Controller Layer (REST APIs)
↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
↓
Repository Layer (JPA / Hibernate)
↓
MySQL Database

This ensures:

Clear separation of concerns

Maintainable codebase

Scalable backend structure

Secure request processing

💳 Core Functionalities
👤 User Module (/api/user/)

Base API Path:

/api/user/

Implemented Features

Secure User Registration

Login with JWT generation

Auto-generated 7-digit account number

View account details

Deposit funds
